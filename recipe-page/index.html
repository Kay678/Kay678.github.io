          <h1>Making The Sauce</h1>

          <p>
            This sauce is a game-changer. It’s the perfect blend of sweet,
            savory, and spicy, with just enough heat to keep things exciting.
            In a small bowl, whisk together honey, brown sugar, soy sauce, 
            water, rice vinegar, sesame oil, minced garlic, and ginger paste.
            The combination of flavors is bold and balanced, with the honey
            adding sweetness and the vinegar bringing a tangy brightness. 
            A bit of cornstarch helps thicken the sauce into that glossy,
            restaurant-style glaze. The best part about this sauce is you 
            don’t have to cook it down separately. You just toss it in the 
            pan with the chicken and veggies and it’ll thicken then!
          </p>   
          <p>
            However there is a second option to making the sauce if you 
            prefer! All you have to do is throw all the ingredients into 
            a small saucepan or pot and whisk together. Transfer to the
            stove over medium heat and cook down the sauce until it simmers 
            and thickens up – about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat once 
            it coats the back of a spoon. Then you can toss the sauce in a 
            bowl with the chicken and veggies instead of doing it over the 
            stove with heat.
          </p>
          
          <h1>Sautéing the Vegetables</h1>

          <p>
            The vegetables in this dish add texture, flavor, and a pop of 
            color. Thinly slice a yellow onion and a couple of jalapeños. 
            The onions caramelize and bring a bit of sweetness while the 
            jalapenos have a smokey spicy taste. They complement each other 
            so well!
          </p>  
          <p>
            If you prefer a milder heat, remove the seeds and stems from 
            the jalapeños before slicing. It will be VERY spicy if you keep 
            the seeds! In a large frying pan, add a drizzle of neutral oil
            and a knob of butter. Sauté the onions and jalapeños for a few
            minutes until they’re slightly softened but still vibrant. This
            step enhances their natural sweetness and mellows the spice 
            just enough to balance the dish. Once cooked, remove the
            vegetables from the pan and set them aside.
          </p>
          
          <h1>Cooking the Chicken</h1>

          <p>In the same pan, we’re going to cook the chicken! The key to 
            that irresistible crispy chicken is a light coating of cornstarch.
            Start by cutting boneless, skinless chicken thighs into bite-sized
            pieces, then toss them in a mixture of cornstarch, salt,
            black pepper, and chili powder. This simple step ensures a 
            golden, crunchy crust without deep frying. Heat neutral oil 
            in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat, and cook the 
            chicken in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Let the 
            chicken cook undisturbed for 3 to 4 minutes before flipping 
            and repeating, allowing it to develop a crisp, golden exterior.
          </p>
          
          <h1>Bringing It All Together</h1>

          <p>
            Once the chicken and vegetables are prepped, it’s time to bring 
            everything together. To the pan with the cooked chicken, add the 
            vegetables back in, then pour the sauce over everything. Toss it 
            all together to ensure the chicken and veggies are evenly coated. 
            Let it cook over medium heat for a few minutes as the sauce 
            thickens and clings to every piece. The flavors will meld
            beautifully, creating a sticky, glossy coating on the chicken 
            and vegetables.
          </p>
          
          <h1>Serving and Garnishing</h1>

          <p>
            This honey jalapeño chicken is best served hot, straight out 
            of the skillet. Spoon it over a bed of steamed rice or your 
            favorite grain to soak up all that incredible sauce. It’s 
            delicious with some chow mein too. For a finishing touch, 
            garnish with freshly chopped cilantro, sliced green onions,
            and a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds. These simple additions 
            add a burst of freshness and a little crunch to each bite.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            It’s bold, flavorful, and so much better than anything you’d 
            get from takeout – give it a try, and you’ll see what I mean!

             </ul>

             <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>

             <ol>
                1.<b>Prepare the Chicken</b>: In a bowl, toss the chopped 
                chicken thighs with cornstarch, salt, and black pepper until 
                evenly coated.

                2.<b>Cook the Chicken</b>: Heat the neutral oil in a large 
                skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the chicken in batches 
                if necessary, and cook until golden brown and crispy on the
                outside and cooked through on the inside, about 6-8 minutes. 
                Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.

                3.<b>Cook the Vegetables</b>: In the same pan, add the sliced
                onion and jalapeños. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until the vegetables
                areslightly softened but still vibrant. Remove the vegetables 
                from the pan and set aside. 

                4.<b>Prepare the Sauce</b>: In a bowl, whisk together the brown
                sugar, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, water, and 
                cornstarch until combined.

                5.<b>Thicken the Sauce</b> Return the skillet to medium 
                heat and pour in the sauce. Cook for a few minutes, 
                stirring continuously, until the sauce thickens.

                6.<b>Combine and Finish</b> Add the cooked chicken 
                and vegetables back into the skillet, tossing to coat 
                everything evenly in the sauce. Cook for an additional 
                1-2 minutes to heat through.

                7.<b>Garnish and Serve</b> Remove from heat and stir in the 
                chopped cilantro. Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds. 
                Serve hot with rice or your favorite side.
