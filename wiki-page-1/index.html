       <b>Crown shyness</b> (also canopy disengagement,[1<sub>] canopy shyness,
       [2<sub>] or inter-crown spacing[3]<sub>) is a phenomenon observed in 
       some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees 
       do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like 
       gaps.[4<sub>][5<sub>] The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of 
       the same species, but also occurs between trees of different 
       species.[6<sub>][7<sub>] There exist many hypotheses as to why crown 
       shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that 
       it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.[8<sub>]

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.[6] 
            The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature since 
            the 1920s.[9] The variety of hypotheses and experimental results 
            might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different 
            species, an example of convergent evolution.[citation needed]

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: trees in windy 
            areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other 
            during winds; the abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness 
            response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely 
            uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.
            [10] If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in 
            the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.[11] This explains 
            instances of crown shyness between branches of the same organism.
            Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen 
            in conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy forests,
            stands of flexible trees, and early succession forests where 
            branches are flexible and limited in lateral movement.
